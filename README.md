This repository includes the frontend for the "first_website".
It is linked with GitHub-pages, so that you can directly access it via:
"horsthacker07.github.io/first_website".
It is also linked to a Vercel web service, so that you can directly access it via:
"horsthacker.vercel.app" - This is the preferred way to access "first_website"
since Github-pages needs much longer to re-employ the website after a change to the repository is initialized.
The Backend-API is based on a python-flask framework.
All included files are located in an another repository.
("github.com/horsthacker07/first_website_backend")
The backend is provided by render-webservices.
The render-webservice is linked to the backend repository.
